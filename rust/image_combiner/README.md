This is a image-combiner tool, based on [this tutorial from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rust-in-replit/).
It takes two input file paths, and one output file path.
E.g. ./image_1.png ./image_2.png ./image_3.png

All three images must be of the same file type.

This is a terrible program, don't use it for anything other than for the meme.
