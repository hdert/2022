An unusably simple calculator, written in Rust, following a [tutorial from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rust-in-replit/).
It takes three values for input, two integers, separated by an operator (+, -, /, \*).
E.g. 2 + 2.

This is a terrible program, don't use it for anything other than for the meme.
